edge-lit



CircuitPython code to run on an M4 chip (ItsyBitsy M4 Express) to run the Adafruit LED Animations library with two buttons; one to advance to the next animation, one to advance the colour of the single colour based animations.



Final design will sit in a laser cut enclosure that will incorporate a slot that lines up with the strip of NeoPixels. A transparent Perspex "sign" that has been laser engraved can then be inserted into the slot and be edge lit with any of the animations/colours.



Multiple signs can be created and swapped out as required.



Code is CircuitPython so that the unit can be connected to a computer and the code easily changed (hopefully engaging, educational and fun).



Now upgraded to CircuitPython 10.



DXF drawings for laser cutting in the Profiles folder (all 5mm thick and all are 240mm x 67mm).



Images to be engraved on 5mm thick transparent Perspex with a 3mm radius on all 4 corners. These "signs" should be 200mm wide but the height will depend on the aspect ratio of the image. General rule: image scaled to be 180mm wide and engraved 10mm down from the top edge and 10mm in from either side. The distance from the bottom edge of the image to the bottom edge of the Perspex to be 53mm.
