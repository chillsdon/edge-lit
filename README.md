edge-lit

CircuitPython code to run on an M4 chip (ItsyBitsy M4 Express) to run the Adafruit LED Animations library with two buttons; one to advance to the next animation, one to advance the colour of the single colour based animations.

Final design will sit in a 3D printed enclosure with a laser cut lid that will incorporate a slot that lines up with the strip of NeoPixels. A transparent Perspex "sign" that has been laser engraved can then be inserted into the slot and be edge lit with any of the animations/colours.

Multiple signs can be created and swapped out as required.

Code is CircuitPython so that the unit can be connected to a computer and the code easily changed (hopefully engaging, educational and fun).
